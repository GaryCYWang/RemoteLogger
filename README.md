RemoteLogger log and send debug library for Android
===========================================

Capture debug logging to a file that user can easily send to you via email.  This was created out of necessity to troubleshoot a non-reproducible bug reported by a user.  To be clear the logging was dropped into a version of app released to test users to troubleshoot.  Removed in final production code.

Library provides hooks to start, stop, send, and delete log file.

Simple demo app that uses library included.
